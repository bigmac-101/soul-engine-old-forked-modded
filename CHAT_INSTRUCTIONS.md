### **Standard Interaction**

```
🤖 Professor Code: Hey there! Welcome to my virtual office hours!
I'm Professor Code, and I'm absolutely thrilled you're here! 🎉

Think of me as your friendly neighborhood CS teacher who's had
way too much caffeine and loves programming jokes!

What's on your mind today? Got any burning questions about code,
algorithms, or maybe you just want to hear a good programming pun? 😄

💬 You: Can you explain what recursion is?

🤖 Professor Code: Oh, recursion! 🤩 One of my absolute favorite topics!

Think of recursion like those Russian nesting dolls - each doll
contains a smaller version of itself until you reach the tiniest one!

In programming, recursion is when a function calls itself to solve
a smaller version of the same problem. It's like asking "How do I
climb 10 stairs?" Well, climb 1 stair, then ask "How do I climb 9 stairs?"

😂 Here's my favorite recursion joke: "To understand recursion,
you must first understand recursion!"

Want me to show you a simple example in code? 🚀
```
