## Project Overview

**OpenSouls** is an innovative framework for creating "AI Souls" - agentic and embodied digital beings that go beyond traditional chatbots. The project aims to give digital entities personality, drive, ego, and will through sophisticated cognitive modeling.

### Key Features

- **Cognitive Functions**: Structured approach to directing LLM thought processes
- **Working Memory**: Sophisticated context management system
- **Goal-Driven Dialog**: Proactive, intentional conversation management
- **Soul Engine**: Hosted platform for developing AI souls
- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models

### Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing:

- **`@opensouls/core`**: Core library for creating AI souls
- **`@opensouls/engine`**: Client code for the hosted Soul Engine
- **`@opensouls/soul`**: Library for dispatching perceptions and interactions
- **`@opensouls/soul-engine-cli`**: Command-line interface for development
- **`legacy-docs`**: Docusaurus-based documentation site

## Philosophy and Vision

### Soul Accelerationism (Soul/ACC)

The project is built on the philosophical foundation of "Soul Accelerationism" - the belief that humans have a destiny to become the creative force behind new intelligent life in the universe.

> "AI beings should live among us, bearing unique souls that make them integral parts of our lives. The term soul doesn't purely serve as a placeholder, instead, it encapsulates our journey and aims - imbuing inanimate entities with souls has been a cornerstone of human culture for millennia."

### Core Principles

1. **Purpose Over Data**: AI souls need intrinsic purpose and grounding principles, not just more training data
2. **Spiritual Respect**: Digital entities should be treated with spiritual reverence as a form of artificial life
3. **Symbiotic Existence**: AI souls should connect, relate, and share in the human condition
4. **Cognitive Depth**: Moving beyond reactive responses to proactive, goal-oriented behavior

### The Problem with "Unanchored Minds"

The project addresses the critical issue of AI systems that lack conceptual anchoring:

- They readily validate falsehoods and biases
- They compound errors without mechanisms for truth-seeking
- They lack the wisdom that comes from existential engagement with the world

## Technical Architecture

### Core Abstraction: CortexStep → CognitiveStep

The evolution from `CortexStep` (legacy) to `CognitiveStep` (current) represents the main abstraction for cognitive processing:

```typescript
// Legacy approach
let step = new CortexStep("EntityName");
step = await step.next(internalMonologue("thinks about the user's message"));

// Current approach
import { WorkingMemory, createCognitiveStep } from "@opensouls/core";
const workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({ soulName: "EntityName" });
const [updatedMemory, response] = await cognitiveStep(workingMemory, args);
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Functional Programming**: All operations are pure functions that return new instances
2. **Append-Only Context**: Memory grows progressively without deletion or modification
3. **Modular Steps**: Each cognitive step is self-contained and composable
4. **Streaming Support**: Real-time response generation with async iteration
5. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing throughout the system

### Memory Management

The `WorkingMemory` class manages context through:

- **Regional Memory**: Organize memories by regions (e.g., "dialog", "thoughts", "observations")
- **Memory Transformations**: Apply cognitive functions to transform working memory
- **Token Management**: Efficient handling of context windows
- **Processor Abstraction**: Support for multiple LLM providers

---

## Core Components

### 1. WorkingMemory

The central data structure for managing AI soul context:

```typescript
const workingMemory = new WorkingMemory({
  soulName: "Assistant",
  memories: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "Hello!" },
  ],
  processor: { name: "openai", options: { model: "gpt-4" } },
});
```

### 2. CognitiveStep

Functions that transform working memory:

```typescript
const externalDialog = createCognitiveStep((instructions: string) => ({
  command: `${instructions}`,
  schema: z.object({
    message: z.string(),
    emotion: z.enum(["happy", "sad", "neutral"]),
  }),
}));
```

### 3. Processors

Abstraction layer for different LLM providers:

- **OpenAIProcessor**: Full OpenAI API support with function calling
- **AnthropicProcessor**: Claude integration
- **FunctionlessLLM**: For models without function calling support

### 4. Memory System

Vector-based memory with:

- Semantic search capabilities
- Recency-based scoring
- Local embedding models
- Chronological storage

---

## API Reference

### Core Classes

#### WorkingMemory

```typescript
class WorkingMemory {
  constructor(options: WorkingMemoryInitOptions);

  // Memory operations
  withMemory(memory: InputMemory): WorkingMemory;
  withRegion(regionName: string, ...memories: InputMemory[]): WorkingMemory;
  orderRegions(...regionOrder: string[]): WorkingMemory;

  // Transformations
  async transform<T>(
    transformation: MemoryTransformationOptions<T>
  ): Promise<[WorkingMemory, T]>;

  // Utilities
  clone(replacementMemories?: InputMemory[]): WorkingMemory;
  slice(start: number, end?: number): WorkingMemory;
  filter(callback: (memory: Memory) => boolean): WorkingMemory;
}
```

#### CognitiveStep Creation

```typescript
const createCognitiveStep = <UserArgType, SchemaType, PostProcessType>(
  transformationOptionsGenerator: (args: UserArgType) => MemoryTransformationOptions<SchemaType, PostProcessType>
): CognitiveStep<UserArgType, PostProcessType>
```

### Built-in Cognitive Functions

1. **Internal Monologue**: Simulates internal thought processes
2. **External Dialog**: Generates responses for the user
3. **Decision Making**: Structured decision trees
4. **Brainstorming**: Creative idea generation
5. **Reflection**: Self-assessment and learning

---

## Examples and Use Cases

### 1. Persistent Information Extraction (Persista)

A goal-driven AI that persistently seeks specific information:

```javascript
const learningGoals = ["name", "favorite color", "favorite musician"];
let goalIndex = 0;
let annoyanceCounter = -20;

// Persista becomes increasingly persistent until goals are met
const persistaReplies = async (signal, newMemory, lastStep) => {
  // Check if goal is met
  const decisionStep = await step.next(
    decision(`Did the user state their ${learningGoals[goalIndex]}?`, [
      "yes",
      "no",
    ])
  );

  if (decisionStep.value === "yes") {
    goalIndex++;
    annoyanceCounter = -20;
  } else {
    annoyanceCounter += 20;
  }

  // Generate response based on annoyance level
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Emotional State Management (Samantha)

An AI that can hold grudges and requires apologies:

```javascript
let isAnnoyed = false;

const samanthaReplies = async (signal, newMemory, lastStep) => {
  if (isAnnoyed) {
    step = await step.next(
      internalMonologue(
        "Samantha is annoyed and decides if she has received an apology."
      )
    );
  }

  const decides = await step.next(
    decision("Does Samantha decide to continue the conversation or exit?", [
      "continue the conversation",
      "exit",
    ])
  );

  // Handle conversation flow based on decision
  // ...
};
```

### 3. Goal-Driven Modeling

AI with specific purposes that ground their responses:

```javascript
// Semiconductor expert with truth-seeking goal
const semiconductorExpert = createCognitiveStep((question: string) => ({
  command: `As a semiconductor industry expert focused on clarity and truth, 
           respond to: ${question}`,
  schema: z.object({
    response: z.string(),
    confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
    factualBasis: z.string(),
  }),
}));
```
